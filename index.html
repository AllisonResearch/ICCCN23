    <h2>Workshop Scope</h2>
    <p>
        Multi- Agent Systems (MAS) has rapidly emerged as an integral sub-field of
        Artificial Intelligence and has presented new and exciting challenges to the community of networking and communications researchers. Within a Multi Agent
        System, several decision making agents interact within a shared environments
        towards a common, or conflicting goal. Multi- Robot Systems (MRS) are a subset of MAS with physical embodiment that presents a unique set of challenges
        and applications. Fundamentally, the cooperation required of both MAS and 
        MRS in achieving their objectives places arduous demands of the networking
        infrastructure, and seeks novel communication solutions.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        This workshop aims to congeal about the community interested in MAS and
        MRS especially as concerned to communication and coordination challenges.
        It intends to facilitate discussions about contemporary problems and solutions,
        towards defining standardized scientific methods and practices for the design,
        development and validation of algorithms and strategies in these domains.
